Startup Profit Prediction – EDA & Linear Regression  
Project Overview  
This project analyzes a dataset of 50 startups to identify factors affecting profitability. We perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and build a Linear Regression model to predict startup success based on investment and location.  
Techniques Used  
- EDA (Data Cleaning, Visualization, Feature Selection)  
- Multiple Linear Regression for profit prediction  
- Joblib for model saving and deployment  

Files in This Repository  
- ML_Startup_Data.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook with full analysis  
- 50_Startups.csv - Dataset used  
- Linear_regression_model.pkl- Trained regression model  

How to Use  
1. Clone this repository  
2. Open ML_Startup_Data.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run all cells to explore data, train models, and use saved models
